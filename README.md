# [Skeleton](https://github.com/rezoh/Skeleton-Stylus)
Skeleton is a simple, responsive boilerplate to kickstart any responsive project.

Check out <http://getskeleton.com> for documentation and details.

## Getting started

### Install Global Dependancies
  * [Node.js](http://nodejs.org)
  * [bower](http://bower.io): `[sudo] npm install bower -g`
  * [bower](http://gulpjs.com/): `[sudo] npm install gulp -g`

### Install Local Dependancies
  * [Download zip](https://github.com/rezoh/Skeleton-Stylus/archive/master.zip) or clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/rezoh/Skeleton-Stylus.git`
  * cd to project folder
  * run `[sudo] npm install` (first time users)
  * run `gulp watch` (to watch and compile stylus files) or `gulp stylus` (to just compile stylus files)

### What Stylus-version can give you?
  - Customizable responsible grid
  - Easy colors and typography customization
  - Modular structure (yeah, you can throw away some modules and feel fine)
  - Nice-looking syntax (it's Stylus, come on)

### What's in the download?

The download includes Skeleton's CSS, Normalize CSS (as a reset), a sample favicon, an index.html and a configuration file for Gulp as a starting point.

```
Skeleton/
├── index.html
├── stylus/
│   ├── skeleton.styl
    └── normailze.styl
└── images/
    └── favicon.ico
├── package.json
└── gulpfile.js

```

### Why it's awesome

Skeleton is lightweight and simple. It styles only raw HTML elements (with a few exceptions) and provides a responsive grid. Nothing more.
- Around 400 lines of CSS unminified and with comments
- It's a starting point, not a UI framework
- ~~No compiling or installing...just vanilla CSS~~ Just beautiful Stylus =)


## Browser support

- Chrome latest
- Firefox latest
- Opera latest
- Safari latest
- IE latest

The above list is non-exhaustive. Skeleton works perfectly with almost all older versions of the browsers above, though IE certainly has large degradation prior to IE9.
